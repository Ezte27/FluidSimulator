![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-FluidSimulator-brightgreen)

This repository hosts a Python-based fluid simulator with pygame rendering, inspired by Sebastian Lague's C# implementation as seen on his YouTube channel. This fluid simulator offers an interactive and visually captivating simulation of fluid dynamics, providing an engaging way to explore the behavior of fluids in a 2D environment.

## Features

- Real-time fluid simulation
- 2D particle-based fluid dynamics
- Interactive and dynamic rendering with pygame
- Easy-to-understand Python codebase

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the FluidSimulator up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ezte27/FluidSimulator.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

3. Run the simulator:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Interact with the simulation and observe the fascinating behavior of the fluid.

## Usage

- Left-click to add fluid particles.
- Right-click and drag to add obstacles that influence the fluid flow.
- Use the keyboard to control various parameters (e.g., viscosity, density, etc.).
- Experiment with different configurations to observe unique fluid dynamics.
